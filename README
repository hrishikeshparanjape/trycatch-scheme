Implementation of try-catch block in Scheme using advanced control structure called continuation. Continuations is a control structure which is not presnt in Java, C, and many other statically typed languages. The main idea in continuations is we can capture a point in a function where we can return later. This makes us possible to roll back to previous state of a function.

Here is wiki page for continuation in case you are unaware about continuations http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation
